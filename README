GLib-based DBus bindings for freesmartphone.org - Vala implementation

We provide two branches for you, dbus-glib and gdbus.

The master branch compiles the bindings against
libdbus and libdbus-glib.

The gdbus branch compiles the bindings against
glib. You will need at least version 2.26.1 for this to work.

There is no master branch.

<THIS IS THE DBUS-GLIB BRANCH>
