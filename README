GLib-based DBus bindings for freesmartphone.org - Vala implementation

We provide two variants you, dbus-glib and gdbus.

The default version (without --gdbus) compiles the bindings against
libdbus and libdbus-glib.

If you supply --gdbus, the bindings are compiled against
glib. You will need at least version 2.26.1 for this to work.
